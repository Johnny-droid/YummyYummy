# YummyYummy Website

This a website made to help users decide in which restaurant to eat. We believe that YummyYummy will allow users to enjoy their meals as much as possible, and at the same time, reward the good restaurants with more clients.

This website will also support take-away orders. The users will be able to order from all the different kinds of restaurants, after creating an account. The restaurant owners will also have access to the orders made to their restaurant in their account.

We hope you like our website after it's done.

YummyYuummy will give you the most YummyYummy Food!!!

# Details we still need to do:

hash passwords/ filter / encode
Talvez quando damos search no index, podemos procurar não só pelo nome, como também pela categoria, e etc em vez de adicionar os filtros, mas temos de mostrar mais info sobre o restaurante;
clean up the code from colorOrders
logout doesn't go to sign up
fix sign up client/courier drop down
editar perfil
donos dos restaurantes, editar perfil dos restaurantes, adicionar/editar pratos, e etc
Courier and Restaurant Owner can change status of deliveries
Fazer css para os botões nas orders


## Extras: 
Adicionar talvez mais coisas à base de dados
Criar adicionar algo na página das orders quando n há nenhuma order
Talvez encontrar maneira de colocar o footer sempre em baixo
Fazer com que as coisas do restaurant fiquem centradas, nos donos de restaurante e couriers que não têm as orders de lado (acho que usar expand deve funcionar)


## DONE
DONE - Restaurant Owners can reply to customers
DONE - adicionar comentários/reviews
DONE - (invetar um número de tele aleatório para colocar no footer e fingir como linha de suport técnico)
DONE - Ask the aditional things for sign up things to sign up and change things from Client/Owner to User
DONE - Don't forget to ask wether it will be user or courier
DONE - Add option to add restaurant to favourites list
DONE - Sort orders according to date
