# YummyYummy Website

This a website made to help users decide in which restaurant to eat. We believe that YummyYummy will allow users to enjoy their meals as much as possible, and at the same time, reward the good restaurants with more clients.

This website will also support take-away orders. The users will be able to order from all the different kinds of restaurants, after creating an account. The restaurant owners will also have access to the orders made to their restaurant in their account.

We hope you like our website after it's done.

YummyYuummy will give you the most YummyYummy Food!!!

# Details we still need to do:

hash passwords
(invetar um número de tele aleatório para colocar no footer e fingir como linha de suport técnico)
adicionar comentários/reviews
editar perfil
donos dos restaurantes, editar perfil dos restaurantes, adicionar/editar pratos, e etc
Add option to add restaurant to favourites list
Ask the aditional things for sign up things to sign up and change things from Client/Owner to User
Don't forget to ask wether it will be user or courier
Courier and Restaurant Owner can change status of deliveries
Restaurant Owners can reply to customers
Sort orders according to date
Fazer com que as coisas do restaurant fiquem centradas, nos donos de restaurante e couriers que não têm as orders de lado
Adicionar talvez mais coisas à base de dados
